# About

In January 2016 I undertook General Assembly's  HTML/CSS/Web Design Circuit part time.  It took place over 10 weeks, where I had an introduction to HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, as well as some  mentorship sessions online.

The final product can be seen in unit_8, where I made a simple Portfolio using Twitter's Bootstrap.
